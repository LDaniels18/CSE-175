#
# This file provides a function implementing breadth-first search for a
# route-finding problem. Various search utilities from "route.py" are
# used in this function, including the classes RouteProblem, Node, and
# Frontier.

#to begin the algorithim
#This is graph work!!! --Traversing through nodes!
#Searching all verticies (a point where two line segments meet (vertex)) -https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/vertices-faces-edges.html
#Use Dictionaries and lists
# TRAVERSE THROUGH EACH VERTEX/VERTICES BY TWO PARTS.. VISTITED AND NOT VISITED:
#Start by putting any one of the graphâ€™s vertices at the back of the queue.
# Now take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.
# Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add those which are not within the visited list to the rear of the queue.
# Keep continuing steps two and three till the queue is empty.

#we need to create a queue to represent the list: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/
