#This is graph work!!! --Traversing through nodes!
#Searching all verticies (a point where two line segments meet (vertex)) -https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/vertices-faces-edges.html
#Use Dictionaries and lists
# TRAVERSE THROUGH EACH VERTEX/VERTICES BY TWO PARTS.. VISTITED AND NOT VISITED:
#Start by putting any one of the graphâ€™s vertices at the back of the queue.
# Now take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.
# Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add those which are not within the visited list to the rear of the queue.
# Keep continuing steps two and three till the queue is empty.


#should we begin by taking the first vertex within the list/graph ???

#we need to create a queue to represent the list: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/

#Data to be used will probably be used -- or we can use our own list:

#to load a file of data:

#creation of the queue:

queue = [] #to take away a checked vertice...
